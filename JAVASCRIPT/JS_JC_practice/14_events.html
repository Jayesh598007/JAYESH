            @ HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements
            @ An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does

            some examples of 'events':
            >> webpage has finished loading
            >> button was clicked
            >> input field has changed

            When events happen, you may want to do something
            HTML allows event handler attributes, with JS, to be added to HTML elements

            <!-- <element event = "some JS code">                  -->
        </p>
    </div>  
    
    <div class="examples">
        <p>
            # changes the content of other element with id = "demo"
            <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">Display Date</button>
            <p id="demo"></p>
            <hr>

            # changes the content of its own using(this.innerHTML)
            <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">Display Date</button>
            <hr>
            
            # when JS codes are long, we can call a function with long JS codes in it
            <button onclick="displayDate()">Display Date</button>
            <p id="date"></p>
            <script>
                function displayDate(){
                    document.getElementById('date').innerHTML = Date();
                }
            </script> 
        </p>
