        <!-- Variables containing many values is known as objects   -->
        <p>
            a car is an 'object'
            <script>
                // car has 'properties' like color,weight,etc
                car.name = "Volvo";
                car.model = "sv2019";
                car.weight = "500Kg";
                car.color = "red";
            </script>
            <script>

            all car have same 'properties', but the property "values" differ from car to car
            all car have same 'methods', but the methods are performed at diff times

            @ Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values
            @ The values are written as "name:value" pairs

            Methods are actions that can be performed on objects

        <p>When a JS variable is declared with the 'new' keyword , the variables is created as an object
            <script>
                const x = new Place();           // declares x as place object
                const y = new college();         // declares x as college object
            </script>
